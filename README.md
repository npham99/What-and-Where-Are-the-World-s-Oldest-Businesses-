# What-and-Where-Are-the-World-s-Oldest-Businesses

This project is on DataCamp, using SQL as the coding language. In this project, I explores data from BusinessFinancing.co.uk on the world's oldest businesses: when they were founded and which industries they belong to.

This project uses querying techniques for data manipulation purpose. I have to practice how to select columns from a table, filtering for rows where they meet a criterion, using aggregation functions, determining the order of rows in the result, performing calculations on groups of rows, filtering grouped data and joining two-three tables by Inner Join.
